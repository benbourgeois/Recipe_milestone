# Recipe Milestone Project

With this site I hope to make the searching for a recipe a little easier in ways. Whether you want something for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or maybe a dessert, its going to be there to see. There will even be an area to tell if this is more on the beginner side or the advanced side. You will be able to look over the recipes and choose from your liking based on what catches your eye. You will see: the name of the dish, the ingredients, the steps to preparing, and that difficulty. If you have a recipe and would like to share it with the world, you can go to the submit your own recipe page and put it out there for everyone. There will even be a section showcasing the wonderful cooking supplies and utensils that you can buy from our brand Bourgeoisie Cooking.
